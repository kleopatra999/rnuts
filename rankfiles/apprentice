~FT+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

~FT   Synopsis~RS : This is the lowest wiz level. This level has some 
              commands that enable the user to do low level maintenance 
              to the talker, and basic wiz commands.  This level typically 
              requires some more responsibility of the user, as far as 
              recruiting, and advertising. At this level, promotion is 
              generally more based on the actions of the individual towards 
              other users, than simply total login time.
