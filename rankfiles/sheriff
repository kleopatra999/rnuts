~FT+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

~FT   Synopsis~RS : This is the third wiz level.  This level contains 
              higher level maintenance commands.  In addition, this level 
              has commands that allow the user excercise more responsibility 
              concerning the status of lower level users, and wizzes.  At 
              this level, promotions are based on previously stated criteria, 
              but more so, the preferences of the owner, since the upper 
              level wizzes must work together to operate the talker.
