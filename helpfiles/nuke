~FT   Usage~RS    : nuke <username> 

   This will delete a user on the system but they cannot be logged in
   at the time so if someone is annoying you .kill them first *then* 
   delete them. Using this command can make you seriously unpopular so 
   you'd better get your facts right about someone before you delete them.
