Marking your way down the northern leaf covered road.  The sun beats down
on you shinning through the trees warming your face.  You pear around
keeping an eye on the woods around you, watching for sudden movements of
anything that is out of place anything not suppose to be there.  As you
continue your travel, you clutch your money sac tighter to you.  Onward
travelling to King Richards Castle, praying you make it safely within the
castle walls.  Your've heard of the many robberies, of this man Robinhood
Prince of Theives, the man who steals from the rich and gives to the poor. 
But... is it him who is wrong? or is it the Sherrif and his taxes?
Wandering farther you ponder... wondering... waiting... hoping you never
find out....
