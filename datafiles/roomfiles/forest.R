The legends of the forest ghosts enchant you with curiousity and twinge
your soul with a moment of fear.  You look around you gazing to find what
lies ahead for you, you hear the trees rustling high above you.  Wooden
wind chimes sound startling you as you peer to see them hanging from a
nearby tree.  You smile knowing children have been hear playing their
childhood games, but yet you still grow weary... Cause you feel the forest
and you know it has eyes everywhere, watching and waiting ... whispering
it's secrets.  You continue to explore this wonderful enchanted forest,
ready for anything that lies waiting for you... But unsure if you are
truly ready for it's secrets...
