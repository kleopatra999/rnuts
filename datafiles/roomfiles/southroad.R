A shout rings through the air, "All stop". You look forward trying to see
what the fuss is all about up ahead, But there are to many people in the
way to yield a decent view. You stand up to get a better look. Squinting
your eyes against the morning sun, you notice two woodsmen standing aways
off arguing with each other. They become aware of your parties presence and
disapear into the woods. A woman behind you screems and you are surounded
by woodsman. Someone blindfolds you, and you remember thinking. o O ( what
the heck is going on ). A sharp blow to your head sends you off to a dream
of blackness.
